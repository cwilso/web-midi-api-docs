# MIDIAccess
Get your browser and [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) enabled devices connected with `MIDIAccess`!

## Definition
`MIDIAccess` is a [Web MIDI API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) interface that provides methods for listing which connected [MIDI devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_controller) are currently available to your browser, and also gives access methods for interconnecting with each device. 

The available devices are split into two categories: **inputs**, and **outputs**.

Essentially, these are the channels by which you send & receive [MIDI messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI#Messages) to and from the browser to any external device you select to be interacted with. For example: a [MIDI controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_controller), or a [MIDI-enabled application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI#Software).

**Note:** MIDI Controller Required

## ðŸš¨ Warning! ðŸš¨
**This is an experimental technology!** It's not quite ready for production projects yet. It is also currently only available in [Chromium-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)) browsers.

## Properties
`MIDIAccess` is a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)  object returned from an invocation of [`navigator.requestMIDIAccess`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/#dom-navigator-requestmidiaccess).

If the promise object is resolved, the [navigator interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator) will return a `MediaAccess` object containing the following properties:
### .inputs
`MediaAccess.inputs` is a [MIDIInputMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MIDIInputMap) containing the ports of all available external devices which can send MIDI messages to the `MIDIAccess` interface for use in the browser. This is a [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)-hybrid which is `read only`, so you cannot use common write-based map functions like `set()`, `clear()`, or `delete()` with it.
### .outputs
`MediaAccess.outputs` is a [MIDIOutputMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MIDIOutputMap) containing the ports of all available external devices which can receive MIDI messages from the MIDIAccess interface. This [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)-hybrid also follows the same `read only` constraints as the [`.inputs`](https://github.com/obensource/web-midi-api-docs/new/master#inputs) property.
### .sysexEnabled
`MediaAccess.sysexEnabled` is a `read only` boolean value that specifies if [System Exclusive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI#System_Exclusive_messages) message support is permitted for a given instance of `MIDIAccess`.
### .onstatechange
`MediaAccess.onstatechange` is an event handler function that returns an [`MIDIConnectionEvent`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/#MIDIConnectionEvent) object anytime a new MIDI port is added, or state changes for an existing port.

## Examples

### Simple Access
Check to see if you browser supports the Web MIDI API, and then ask navigator for `MIDIAccess` and pass the result to your handlers (eg. `onMIDIAccess` & `onMIDIAccessFailure`).
```
if (navigator.requestMIDIAccess) {
  navigator.requestMIDIAccess({ sysex: false }).then(onMIDIAccess, onMIDIAccessFailure)
} else {
  console.warn(â€™This browser does not support MIDI.â€™)
}
```

If access has been gained, you can begin to use a `MIDIAccess` object!
```
const onMIDIAccess = (midiAccessObject)  => {
  console.log(â€˜The MIDI Access Object:â€™, midiAccessObject)
}
```

### Rejection Handling
In case of a rejection, you can refer the user to a great Web MIDI API [polyfill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)) so theyâ€™re able to use the Web MIDI API.

A [MIDI-detector test](http://cwilso.github.io/WebMIDIAPIShim/) can be used to determine if your browser currently supports the Web MIDI API (just hit the â€˜test midiâ€™ button below).

If it does not, you can inject this markup into your HTML source code to attain access to the Web MIDI API:
`<script src='http://cwilso.github.com/WebMIDIAPIShim/build/WebMIDIAPI.min.js'></script>`

### Error Handling
Errors typically occur in two cases: there are no MIDI devices currently available, or your browser doesnâ€™t support the Web MIDI API.

In any case, handling an error allows you to alert the user of their best options, and log standard errors:
```
const onMIDIAccessFailure = (err) {
  console.log(`No MIDI devices are available, or the Web MIDI API isnâ€™t supported by this browser.`)
  console.log(`Utilize this Web MIDI API Polyfill in order to use the Web MIDI API: http://cwilso.github.io/WebMIDIAPIShim/`)
  console.log(err)
}
```

### Work with raw MIDI data
By looping through the available input values from connected devices, you can pass every message to a handler and begin doing incredible things with MIDI! Right in your browser! ðŸ™Œ
```
const onMIDIAccess = (midiAccessObject) => {
  let inputs = midiAccessObject.inputs.values()
  for (let input = inputs.next(); input && !input.done; input = inputs.next()) {
    input.value.onmidimessage = onMIDIMessage
  }  
}

const onMIDIMessage = (message) => {
  console.log(`Raw MIDI message data: ${message.data}`)
}
```
